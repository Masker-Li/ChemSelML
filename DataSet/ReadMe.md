## Reaction data
### 3D structure files
The **xyz** format structure files can be downloaded from this link:

### SMILES data
We collated the training set with the reaction data represented by smiles and placed it in **Canonicalized_SMILES_Reactions_input_data.csv**    
Transition state energy barriers are stored under the **Output** column or the **DG_TS** column. They are the same.   
   
Notes: the means of **Product_name**: Ar{Num} -> Arene_{Num}; R{Num} -> Radical_{Num}. The columns after **Divider** are raw information that can be used to assist in determining the similarity of reactants and products.
